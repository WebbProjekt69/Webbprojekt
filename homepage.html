        There are 104 achievements in the Bedrock Edition, 87 achievements in the Xbox One Edition and Nintendo Switch Edition, 93 achievements in the Xbox 360 Edition and Wii U Edition, 94 trophies in the PlayStation 3 Edition and PlayStation Vita Edition, 111 trophies in the PlayStation 4 Edition, and 59 achievements in the New Nintendo 3DS Edition.
        Achievements are tracked per user account, and per edition. In other words, one user account will have one (and only one) set of achievements on Windows 10, one set on Android, one set on Fire OS, and so on. They are not tracked separately per world; achievements earned in one world apply to all worlds using that edition and that user account. You have to be logged in to your Xbox Live account to earn them.
        They are independent of one another, allowing players to get them in any order. Once earned, they cannot be reset.
        Achievements can only be earned in Survival mode. If the game is saved while in Creative mode, or if host privileges in Legacy Console Edition are enabled, the ability to earn achievements in that world is permanently disabled. Going back to Survival mode or disabling host privileges will not re-enable it.
